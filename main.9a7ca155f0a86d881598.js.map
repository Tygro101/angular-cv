In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {SchedulerLike} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn(scheduler, delay) {\n    if (delay === void 0) {\n        delay = 0;\n    }\n    return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source) {\n        return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n    };\n}\nvar ObserveOnOperator = /*@__PURE__*/ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) {\n            delay = 0;\n        }\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    ObserveOnOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n    };\n    return ObserveOnOperator;\n}());\nexport { ObserveOnOperator };\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar ObserveOnSubscriber = /*@__PURE__*/ /*@__PURE__*/ (function (_super) {\n    tslib_1.__extends(ObserveOnSubscriber, _super);\n    function ObserveOnSubscriber(destination, scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) {\n            delay = 0;\n        }\n        var _this = _super.call(this, destination) || this;\n        _this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        _this.delay = delay;\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /** @nocollapse */\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch = function (arg) {\n        var notification = arg.notification, destination = arg.destination;\n        notification.observe(destination);\n        this.unsubscribe();\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype.scheduleMessage = function (notification) {\n        this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch, this.delay, new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._error = function (err) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n    };\n    return ObserveOnSubscriber;\n}(Subscriber));\nexport { ObserveOnSubscriber };\nvar ObserveOnMessage = /*@__PURE__*/ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function ObserveOnMessage(notification, destination) {\n        this.notification = notification;\n        this.destination = destination;\n    }\n    return ObserveOnMessage;\n}());\nexport { ObserveOnMessage };\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map\n","/** PURE_IMPORTS_START _observable_empty,_observable_of,_observable_throwError PURE_IMPORTS_END */\n/** PURE_IMPORTS_START _observable_empty,_observable_of,_observable_throwError PURE_IMPORTS_END */\nimport { empty } from './observable/empty';\nimport { of } from './observable/of';\nimport { throwError } from './observable/throwError';\n/**\n * Represents a push-based event or value that an {@link Observable} can emit.\n * This class is particularly useful for operators that manage notifications,\n * like {@link materialize}, {@link dematerialize}, {@link observeOn}, and\n * others.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * @ngModule CommonModule\n */\nvar NgForOf = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function NgForOf(_viewContainer, _template, _differs) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._ngForOfDirty = true;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForOf\", {\n        set: function (ngForOf) {\n            this._ngForOf = ngForOf;\n            this._ngForOfDirty = true;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if (console && console.warn) {\n                    console.warn(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \" +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n            // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n            // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n            // should be acceptable.\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgForOf.prototype.ngDoCheck = function () {\n        if (this._ngForOfDirty) {\n            this._ngForOfDirty = false;\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var value = this._ngForOf;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * ### Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * ### Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule CommonModule\n */\nvar NgIf = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            assertTemplate('ngIfThen', templateRef);\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            assertTemplate('ngIfElse', templateRef);\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return NgIf;\n}());\nvar NgIfContext = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function NgIfContext() {\n        this.$implicit = null;\n        this.ngIf = null;\n    }\n    return NgIfContext;\n}());\nfunction assertTemplate(property, templateRef) {\n    var isTemplateRefOrNull = !!(!templateRef || templateRef.createEmbeddedView);\n    if (!isTemplateRefOrNull) {\n        throw new Error(property + \" must be a TemplateRef, but received '\" + ɵstringify(templateRef) + \"'.\");\n    }\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

* Note that timezone correction is not applied to an ISO string that has no time component, such as \"2016-09-19\"\n *\n * ### Format examples\n *\n * These examples transform a date into various formats,\n * assuming that `dateObj` is a JavaScript `Date` object for\n * year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11,\n * given in the local time for the `en-US` locale.\n *\n * ```\n * {{ dateObj | date }}               // output is 'Jun 15, 2015'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'medium' }}      // output is 'Jun 15, 2015, 9:43:11 PM'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'shortTime' }}   // output is '9:43 PM'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'mmss' }}        // output is '43:11'\n * ```\n *\n * ### Usage example\n *\n * The following component uses a date pipe to display the current date in different formats.\n *\n * ```\n * @Component({\n *  selector: 'date-pipe',\n *  template: `<div>\n *    <p>Today is {{today | date}}</p>\n *    <p>Or if you prefer, {{today | date:'fullDate'}}</p>\n *    <p>The time is {{today | date:'h:mm a z'}}</p>\n *  </div>`\n * })\n * // Get the current date and time as a date-time value.\n * export class DatePipeComponent {\n *   today: number = Date.now();\n * }\n * ```\n *\n */\n// clang-format on\nvar DatePipe = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function DatePipe(locale) {\n        this.locale = locale;\n    }\n    DatePipe_1 = DatePipe;\n

The trigger is attached to an element in the component's\n * template, using \"@_trigger_name_\", and a state expression that is evaluated\n * at run time to determine whether the animation should start.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *       transition('on => off', [\n *         animate(\"1s\")\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Preserving whitespace\n *\n * Removing whitespace can greatly reduce AOT-generated code size, and speed up view creation.\n * As of Angular 6, default for `preserveWhitespaces` is false (whitespace is removed).\n * To change the default setting for all components in your application, set\n * the `preserveWhitespaces` option of the AOT compiler.\n *\n * Current implementation removes whitespace characters as follows:\n * - Trims all whitespaces at the beginning and the end of a template.\n * - Removes whitespace-only text nodes. For example,\n * `<button>Action 1</button>  <button>Action 2</button>` becomes\n * `<button>Action 1</button><button>Action 2</button>`.\n * - Replaces a series of whitespace characters in text nodes with a single space.\n * For example, `<span>\\n some text\\n</span>` becomes `<span> some text </span>`.\n * - Does NOT alter text nodes inside HTML tags such as `<pre>` or `<textarea>`,\n * where whitespace characters are significant.\n *\n * Note that these transformations can influence DOM nodes layout, although impact\n * should be minimal.\n *\n * You can override the default behavior to preserve whitespace characters\n * in certain fragments of a template. For example, you can exclude an entire\n * DOM sub-tree by using the `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>\n *     whitespaces are preserved here\n *     <span>    and here </span>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You can force a single space to be preserved in a text node by using `&ngsp;`,\n * which is replaced with a space character by Angular's template\n * compiler:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a>Spaces</a>&ngsp;<a>between</a>&ngsp;<a>links.</a>\n * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>\n *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>\n * ```\n *\n * Note that sequences of `&ngsp;` are still collapsed to just one space character when\n * the `preserveWhitespaces` option is set to `false`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a>before</a>&ngsp;&ngsp;&ngsp;<a>after</a>\n * <!-->compiled to be equivalent to:</>\n *  <a>Spaces</a> <a>between</a> <a>links.</a>\n * ```\n *\n * To preserve sequences of whitespace characters, use the\n * `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute.\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar Component = /*@__PURE__*/ makeDecorator('Component', function (c) {\n    if (c === void 0) {\n        c = {};\n    }\n    return (__assign({ changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default }, c));\n}, Directive, undefined, function (type, meta) { return (function () { })(type, meta); });\n/**\n *\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar Pipe = /*@__PURE__*/ makeDecorator('Pipe', function (p) { return (__assign({ pure: true }, p)); }, undefined, undefined, function (type, meta) { return (function () { })(type, meta); });\n/**\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar Input = /*@__PURE__*/ makePropDecorator('Input', function (bindingPropertyName) { return ({ bindingPropertyName: bindingPropertyName }); });\n/**\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar Output = /*@__PURE__*/ makePropDecorator('Output', function (bindingPropertyName) { return ({ bindingPropertyName: bindingPropertyName }); });\n/**\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar HostBinding = /*@__PURE__*/ makePropDecorator('HostBinding', function (hostPropertyName) { return ({ hostPropertyName: hostPropertyName }); });\n/**\n * Binds a CSS event to a host listener and supplies configuration metadata.\n * Angular invokes the supplied handler method when the host element emits the specified event,\n * and updates the bound element with the result.\n * If the handler method returns false, applies `preventDefault` on the bound element.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * The following example declares a directive\n * that attaches a click listener to a button and counts clicks.\n *\n * ```\n * @Directive({selector: 'button[counting]'})\n * class CountClicks {\n *   numberOfClicks = 0;\n *\n *   @HostListener('click', ['$event.target'])\n *   onClick(btn) {\n *     console.log('button', btn, 'number of clicks:', this.numberOfClicks++);\n *  }\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'app',\n *   template: '<button counting>Increment</button>',\n * })\n * class App {}\n * ```\n *\n * @Annotation\n */\nvar HostListener = /*@__PURE__*/ makePropDecorator('HostListener', function (eventName, args) { return ({ eventName: eventName, args: args }); });\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

hooks (depending on the node\n// flags in lifecycle). Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are\n// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the\n// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a\n// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the\n// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the\n// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending\n// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of\n// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This\n// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an\n// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the\n// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element\n// and D is a directive)\n//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index\n//    E1        0                6\n//      E2      1                1\n//       D3     2                0\n//      E4      3                5\n//       E5     4                4\n//        E6    5                2\n//        E7    6                3\n// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the\n// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +\n// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit\n// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or\n// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the\n// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have\n// lifecycle hooks).\n//\n// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the\n// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to\n// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will\n// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of\n// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and\n// pass is complete.\n//\n// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()\n// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected\n// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.\n// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.\n// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it\n// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().\nfunction callLifecycleHooksChildrenFirst(view, lifecycles) {\n    if (!(view.def.nodeFlags & lifecycles)) {\n        return;\n    }\n    var nodes = view.def.nodes;\n    var initIndex = 0;\n    for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n        var nodeDef = nodes[i];\n        var parent_1 = nodeDef.parent;\n        if (!parent_1 && nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n            // matching root node (e.g. a pipe)\n            callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n        }\n        if ((nodeDef.childFlags & lifecycles) === 0) {\n            // no child matches one of the lifecycles\n            i += nodeDef.childCount;\n        }\n        while (parent_1 && (parent_1.flags & 1 /* TypeElement */) &&\n            i === parent_1.nodeIndex + parent_1.childCount) {\n            // last child of an element\n            if (parent_1.directChildFlags & lifecycles) {\n                initIndex = callElementProvidersLifecycles(view, parent_1, lifecycles, initIndex);\n            }\n            parent_1 = parent_1.parent;\n        }\n    }\n}\nfunction callElementProvidersLifecycles(view, elDef, lifecycles, initIndex) {\n    for (var i = elDef.nodeIndex + 1; i <= elDef.nodeIndex + elDef.childCount; i++) {\n        var nodeDef = view.def.nodes[i];\n        if (nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n            callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n        }\n        // only visit direct children\n        i += nodeDef.childCount;\n    }\n    return initIndex;\n}\nfunction callProviderLifecycles(view, index, lifecycles, initIndex) {\n    var providerData = asProviderData(view, index);\n    if (!providerData) {\n        return;\n    }\n    var provider = providerData.instance;\n    if (!provider) {\n        return;\n    }\n    Services.setCurrentNode(view, index);\n    if (lifecycles & 1048576 /* AfterContentInit */ &&\n        shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, 512 /* InitState_CallingAfterContentInit */, initIndex)) {\n        provider.ngAfterContentInit();\n    }\n    if (lifecycles & 2097152 /* AfterContentChecked */) {\n        provider.ngAfterContentChecked();\n    }\n    if (lifecycles & 4194304 /* AfterViewInit */ &&\n        shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, 768 /* InitState_CallingAfterViewInit */, initIndex)) {\n        provider.ngAfterViewInit();\n    }\n    if (lifecycles & 8388608 /* AfterViewChecked */) {\n        provider.ngAfterViewChecked();\n    }\n    if (lifecycles & 131072 /* OnDestroy */) {\n        provider.ngOnDestroy();\n    }\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
